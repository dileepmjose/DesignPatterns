The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes,
 usually by calling one of their methods.The observer pattern is also a key part in the familiar model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.The observer pattern is implemented in numerous 
 programming libraries and systems, including almost all GUI toolkits.
